								<h5> 
									Dr. Yen has a long history with the Pacific Northwest. Born and raised in Seattle, he graduated from Evergreen High School in Burien. Following his education in Tacoma and California, he returned back in 1991. When he is not in the office treating patients, much of his time is spent with his wife Nancy and their 2 kids. In addition, Dr. Yen is an skier and an avid fly fisherman, and when he's not in the office he can be found either on the slopes or knee-deep in one of our local rivers. <br> When the need arises, Dr. Yen advise you on not only conservative options but also address your case from the surgical aspect. With staff privileges at various local hospitals, the necessity to maintain his continuing medical education with the latest techniques throughout his career is addressed. He has written numerous articles for the "Journal of American Podiatric Medical Association" and has served in various capacities for the Washington State Podiatric Medical Association. When the necessity for medical advice arises, you cannot find yourself in the hands of better care. </h5>
