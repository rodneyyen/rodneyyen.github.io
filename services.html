Ankle pain and instablity is frequently found in active individuals. Tendonitis, arthritis, inflammed ligaments, and pulled muscles can all cause unnecessary discomfort. Bony spurs continue to grow if not addressed. Fractures, or broken bones, and sprains may necessitate a period of non-weight bearing and immobilization.
